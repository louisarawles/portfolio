## Purpose
I designed this portfolio to showcase my academic career, co-curriculars and experiences, as well as my personal software projects. The website is frequently updated to include new projects I have undertaken and experiences I have partaken in.

npm@7.18.1 or higher

After that, you can install the dependencies either using NPM or Yarn.
