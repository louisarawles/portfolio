                <p>
                Data interpretation is at the heart of the NFL, from league records to player injury recoveries. 
                Additionally, it powers sports betting.
                I'm curious how software and machine learning can take the mass amounts of data recorded during the NFL season and manipulate it to provide insights on both realms.
                I don't want to make money off of the software, but I want to see how numbers and effective analysis can predict outcomes.
                <br>
                <br> 
                This project focuses on scraping data from NFL statistics, including game and player data, to build a machine learning model for predicting player and team performace.
                The project involves data collection and parsing through scraping classes, date parsing functions and encapsulation classes to store information into a structured database.
                The machine learning model is a classifier trained using gini and entropy training mechanisms modeled in a decision tree structure.
                The project is written in Python, utilizing libraries such as requests for retrieving the JSON object, NumPy and Matplotlib for data analysis, and Pandas and Sklearn for data manipulation and model training.
                The database is managed using SQLite for efficient data storage and retrieval.
                <br>
                <br>
                Currently, in the project's beginning stages, the program only outputs descriptive analytics, but once the existing raw data is parsed and organized into each of the respective tables, I can train and enhance
                my ML model.

                My QB Passing Zone Success Rating Plot takes in a player and a game object and mimics the passing zone layout on a field and translates the raw data into meaningful performance information.
                The plot visualizes the QB's relative performance against the game's average across the field, highlighting strengths and potential execution deficits.
                The thresholds, below, average, and above, are defined by the NFL and relative to the overall game QB rating average.
                My plot not only shows the success level, but also the QB's individual ratings, which enhances performance evaluation capabilities by enabling players to compare their raw scores across games.

                These specific plots are significant going into the Wild Card game on 01/10/2026. Looking at past scores, Jordan Love hit above average success levels in four different zones and exceeded his opponent's game record
                in two of them. Additionally, he appears to have kept a tighter focus on specific lanes, as he left three zones unattempted. While that's only one more than his opponent, its 1/4 of the field untouched compared
                to Williams' 1/6. 
                <br>
                <br>
                As a Bears fan, I'm hoping Love's high success levels fail to translate into the Wild Card game, but my plots hint at a high performance outlook.
                I hope Caleb Williams made note of his weaker zones on the field and practiced accordingly--go Bears.

                Love again outperforms Williams and leaves a larger portion of the field untouched.
                Defensively, the Bears are taking a hit where Love keeps nailing snaps past 20 yards in the right third of the field.
                If they can slow him down and Williams improves his performance in the latter half of the field, they might have a shot at turning the game around.

                In the second half of the game, Williams caught up to Love in hitting the above average success level.
                Simultaneously, Love lowered his score in the crucial 20Plus, rightThird corner--
                giving the Bears the edge they needed to win the game 31-27.

                While these data visualizations designed with Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib are not predictive statistics,
                they provide telling information on likely QB passing performance and thus, strategy insights.
